Hi 👋 My name is Rubens Costa!
==========================

Full Stack Software Developer
-----------------------------

I'm 28 years old, I love to code and figure out how to solve problems. My main focus is front and back-end development, developing applications that impact the lives of thousands of people.



- 🌍 I'm based in São Paulo, Brazil
- 🔭 I'm developing a personal text-to-speech mobile app with the aim to use some updated APIs to convert text to natural language and add some extra features.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning how to integrate cloud resources with Firebase API and Clean Architecture to make apps more flexible and scalable.
- 📫 You can contact me at rubecostt@gmail.com.
- 😄 Fun fact: my favorite movie genres are sci-fi and medieval. And even if it doesn't look like it, despite my thinness, I go to the gym and do weight training.
